## My process

I started with the mobile aspect and spent a bit of time tinkering with the css, the eyedropper tool from Firefox dev tools was a great help in narrowing down the colors from the examples.
The style guide was helpful but I wanted to try practicing 'eyeballing' it. The desktop media query was a little trickier to figure out with the sizing of the component, but learned a bit about 
css margins.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

There's a lot of nuance to how css properties work together and against each other and while this project introduced me to a few, I'm certain there will be more practice necessary to fully understand how CSS can work in a project.
